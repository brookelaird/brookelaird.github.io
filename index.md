# Brooke Laird
Hi there! My name is Brooke and I am a senior Geography and Environmental Studies major at Middlebury College. I am passionate about using GIS, remote sensing techniques, and cartographic design to expand on studies of environmental justice, climate change adaptation, and landcover change.

On this page you will find my work from various courses, independent study, and research positions.

## Open Source GIScience Analyses
1. [The Gravity Model of Spatial Interaction](gravity/gravity.md)
2. [Replication of the Rosgen Stream Classification](rosgen/finalReport.md)
3. [Analyzing Flood Risk to Schools in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania](daressalaam/report.md)
4. [Vulnerability modeling for sub-Saharan Africa](malcomb/report.md)
5. [Spatial-temporal and content analysis of Twitter Data](twitter/report.md)
6. [Spatial Accessibility of COVID-19 Healthcare Resources](kang/report.md)

## Reflections on Open Source GIS
1. [What is Open Source GIScience?](reflection/open-source.md)
2. [GIS as a Replicable and Reproducable Science](reflection/blogpost-2.md)
3. [Error and Uncertainty in GIScience](reflection/blogpost-3.md)
4. [Spatial, Temporal, and Content Analysis of Twitter for Wildfire Hazards](reflection/blogpost-4.md)
5. [Crowd-sourced and Volunteered Geographic Information](reflection/blogpost-5.md)
6. [Reproducibility and Ethical Geospatial Reserach](reflection/blogpost-6.md)

## Cartography
1. [Historic Redlining in the City of Boston](Cartography/bostonRedlining.png)
2. [Solar Panel Site Selection](Cartography/sitedecision.png)
3. [Development Challenges of Vermont's Natural Landscape](Cartography/solarDev.png)
4. [The Power of Local Level Conservation](Cartography/localconservation.png)
5. [Wetland Composition of Coastal Maine](Cartography/mainewetlands.png)

## Climate Change, Adaptation and Development
I have conducted an analysis of wetland restoration and development efforts in the Southern Iraqi Marshlands as a term paper for my senior seminar, Geographies of Climate Change and Adaptation. You can check out my final paper [here!](GEOG438/marshpolicy.pdf) This work is currently being continued as part of my senior research on climate change cartography and environmental mapping.

## Remote Sensing
I have expanding my experience in remote sensing through Remote Sensing and Land Use, and Remote Sensing for the Geosciences. This past spring, I worked for Professor Niwaeli Kimambo (Middlebury College Geography Department) on developing methods for detecting woodlot growth in Tanzania, with a focus on visualizing the detected results. The poster presentation for this work can be found [here,](RemoteSensing/SymposiumPoster.pdf) as well as a [photo](RemoteSensing/PosterSesh) of our presentation at the Middlebury Spring Research Symposium.
