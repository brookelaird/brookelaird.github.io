# Brooke Laird's Open Source GIScience Work
Hi there! My name is Brooke and I am a junior Geography and Environmental Studies major at Middlebury. I am excited to learn more about the world of Open Source GIS this spring semester, and I will be sharing my work, progress, and reflections here. You can also check out the content for the rest of the course, as well as my peer's work, on [this page](https://gis4dev.github.io).

## GIScience Analyses
1. [The Gravity Model of Spatial Interaction](gravity/gravity.md)
2. [Replication of the Rosgen Stream Classification](rosgen/finalReport.md)
3. [Analyzing Flood Risk to Schools in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania](daressalaam/report.md)
4. [Vulnerability modeling for sub-Saharan Africa](malcomb/report.md)
5. [Spatial-temporal and content analysis of Twitter Data](twitter/report.md)
6. [Spatial Accessibility of COVID-19 Healthcare Resources](kang/report.md)

## Reflections
1. [What is Open Source GIScience?](reflection/open-source.md)
2. [GIS as a Replicable and Reproducable Science](reflection/blogpost-2.md)
3. [Error and Uncertainty in GIScience](reflection/blogpost-3.md)
4. [Spatial, Temporal, and Content Analysis of Twitter for Wildfire Hazards](reflection/blogpost-4.md)
5. [Crowd-sourced and Volunteered Geographic Information](reflection/blogpost-5.md)
6. [Reproducibility and Ethical Geospatial Reserach](reflection/blogpost-6.md)

# Additional Work in Geography
Outside of my projects and reflections in Open Source GIScience, I have completed work in cartography, remote sensing, and climate and development geographies. You can check out some of my additional work at the links below!

## Cartography
1. [Historic Redlining in the City of Boston](Cartography/bostonRedlining.png)
2. [Solar Panel Site Selection](Cartography/sitedecision.png)
3. [Development Challenges of Vermont's Natural Landscape](Cartography/solarDev.png)
4. [The Power of Local Level Conservation](Cartography/localconservation.png)
5. [Wetland Composition of Coastal Maine](Cartography/mainewetlands.png)

## Climate Change, Adaptation and Development
This semester I have conducted an analysis of wetland restoration and development efforts in the Southern Iraqi Marshlands as a term paper for my senior seminar, Geographies of Climate Change and Adaptation. You can check out my final paper [here!](GEOG438/marshpolicy.pdf)
