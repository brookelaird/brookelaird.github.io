# Brooke Laird's Open Source GIScience Work
Hi there! My name is Brooke and I am a junior Geography and Environmental Studies major at Middlebury. I am excited to learn more about the world of Open Source GIS this spring semester, and I will be sharing my work, progress, and reflections here. You can also check out the content for the rest of the course, as well as my peer's work, on [this page](https://gis4dev.github.io).

## GIScience Analyses
1. [The Gravity Model of Spatial Interaction](gravity/gravity.md)
2. [Replication of the Rosgen Stream Classification](rosgen/finalReport.md)
3. [Analyzing Flood Risk to Schools in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania](daressalaam/report.md)
4. [Vulnerability modeling for sub-Saharan Africa](malcomb/report.md) 

## Reflections
1. [What is Open Source GIScience?](reflection/open-source.md)
2. [GIS as a Replicable and Reproducable Science](reflection/blogpost-2.md)
3. [Error and Uncertainty in GIScience](reflection/blogpost-3.md)
